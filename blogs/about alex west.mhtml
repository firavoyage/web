It costs $3k once. And it's a bargain really.

Maybe I should focus on that!

          <p>Started writing the monthly blog post. For February.

A few things I'm writing about:

- Inevitably, making mistakes
- Avoiding ruin
- Avoiding shiny object syndrome</p>

          <p>It's hard to get inspired in a house full of noise. Siblings, =

          <p>The last few days I have been integrating some new features in=
to the Cyberleads website.

I have focused hard on agencies, and I am moving towards being a no-brainer=

One day you get a new paying customer and feel like you can conquer the wor=

I have doubled down on what's working but haven't done much else, really.

Zero creativity.

          <p>Found this note on my work laptop.

It's from March, 2020. Just a few months ago.

My whole dream was to reach $800 MRR, aka $10k ARR.

Some months since then, I have made three times that amount.

But as you can imagine, I'm still not content. I still have the hunger to g=
row Cyberleads.

          <p>Happiness is very abstract. Here is my favorite heuristic to m=
easure my happiness levels.

How excited am I for the next day when I go to bed?

How excited am I when I get up in the morning?

For example, it=E2=80=99s Friday night and I can=E2=80=99t wait for Saturda=

Raw, little moments of random peoples' lives.

With my phone I would be terrified to take a photo of someone.

With my camera I feel fearless.

It's one of those things where it's as awkward as you make it.</p>

          <p>In street photography you are supposed to be a ghost.

However, some of my favorite photos are when the subject recognizes your ex=
istence, moments before the shutter fires.

With my friends we call it "getting busted".

Zoom in to see better.</p>

          <p>Communication without words is beautiful.

And this is coming from someone who loves writing.

Which is using ONLY words to get your points across.

But sometimes communication with no words is better.

Like a little love between two new best friends that actually can't talk to=
 each other.</p>

Are they sad? Are they content? Or are they numb?</p>

Part of the reason was because writing is a transformative experience.

It's like sculpturing, but you're carving yourself.

But daily blogs don't do that for me.

I'm trying to battle my thirst for MRR, since the Playbook is doing pretty =
well and has been getting consistent sales.

It costs $3k once. And it's a bargain really.

Maybe I should focus on that!

        <p>2020 was the best year of my life.

Started CyberLeads. Scaled it. Surpassed my salary. Quit my day job.

I'm not going to go over all the story. Or the things I've learned. I've al=
ready done that in 2YOBP, 2.5YOBP, 3YOBP and WIQMJ

I'll keep this sweet and simple. Just like last year.

Actually, I'm sitting in the exact same spot I wrote...</p>

        <p>Sounds strange, but 2020 was the best year of my life.

Moved abroad. Started a full time job. Started a side business. Scaled it. =
Surpassed my salary. Saved up a lot of money. Lowered my burn rate. Quit my=
 day job. Gained my financial freedom.

This blog post is the sequel of 2.5 years of building products.

        <p>As many of you already know, I recently decided to quit my job a=
nd go full time on CyberLeads.

It's been a long time coming. I launched CyberLeads nearly one year ago. Bu=
t it's been three years since I first started building products and dreamin=

In this blog post I will explain in detail what happened and how I went fro=

While writing my article about my two years of building products, I noticed=

        <p>This is not a success story. This is not a "humble brag".

In 2018 I start with a goal of reaching $500 MRR through my side projects.

Six months in, I am at $50 MRR, riding a huge wave of momentum.

Fourteen months in, I am at $200 MRR and have three profitable products.
