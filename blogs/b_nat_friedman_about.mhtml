  <h2>Nat Friedman</h2>

	<p>I'm an investor, entrepreneur, developer.</p>
=09
	Some things about me:
	<ul>
		<li>Grew up in Charlottesville, VA</li>
		<li>On the Internet since 1991, which is my actual "home town"</li>
		<li>Went to MIT because I loved the Richard Feynman <a href=3D"https://ww=
w.amazon.com/Richard-P-Feynman/e/B000AQ47U8/ref=3Ddp_byline_cont_pop_book_1=
">autobiographies</a></li>
		<li>Started <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian">two</a> <a h=
ref=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin">companies</a></li>
		<li>CEO of <a href=3D"https://github.com/">GitHub</a> from 2018 through 2=
021</li>
		<li>Live in California</li>
		<li>Working on reading the <a href=3D"https://scrollprize.org/">Herculane=
um Papyri</a></li>
	</ul>

	Some things I believe:
	<ul>
		<li>As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the=
 universe to our preferences</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Technology, which is really <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki=
/The_Beginning_of_Infinity">knowledge</a>, enables this</li>
			<li>You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Enthusiasm matters!</li>
		<ul>
			<li>It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you</li>
			<li>It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reaso=
n</li>
			<li>Energy is a necessary input for progress</li>
		</ul>
		<li>It's important to do things fast</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality m=
ore frequently</li>
			<li>Going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for =
bullshit</li>
			<li>"Slow is fake"</li>
			<li>A week is 2% of the year</li>
			<li>Time is the denominator</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The efficient market hypothesis is a lie</li>
		<ul>
			<li>At best it is a very lossy heuristic</li>
			<li>The best things in life occur where EMH is wrong</li>
			<li>In many cases it's more accurate to model the world as 500 people th=
an 8 billion</li>
			<li>"Most people are other people"</li>
		</ul>
		<li>We know less than we think</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The replication crisis is not an aberration</li>
			<li>Many of the things we believe are wrong</li>
			<li>We are often not even asking the right questions</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Great individuals should be fully empowered to exercise their judgme=
nt</li>
			<li>The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelat=
ed levels of excellence in some dimension</li>
			<li>The downsides are worth it</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Smaller teams are better</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun</li>
			<li>No need to chop up work for political reasons</li>
			<li>No room for mediocre people (can pay more, too!)</li>
			<li>Large-scale engineering projects are more soluble in IQ than they ap=
pear</li>
			<li>Many tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Where do you get your dopamine?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The answer is predictive of your behavior</li>
			<li>Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from havi=
ng them validated</li>
			<li>It's ok to get yours from "making things happen"</li>
		</ul>
		<li>You can do more than you think</li>
		<ul>
			<li>We are tied down by invisible orthodoxy</li>
			<li>The laws of physics are the only limit</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	Investing:
	<ul>
		<li>My current areas of interest are AI, infrastructure, open source, and=
 (some) frontier tech</li>

1M and $100M</li>
